My Arch installation uses both dwm and KDE Plasma. I use colemak as my keyboard layout and st as my terminal emulator.

Some packages I use: xcompmgr oh-my-zsh pywall
For a school computer I use macOS.

I have attached a screenshot to the setup

I do not have sudo so some of the stuff doesn't really work.

Setup details:
tmux + nvim + iTerm2 + homebrew

Packages used:
cmatrix ranger htop spt (spotify-tui) spicetify spotifyd cava

Desktop Environment:
yabai + skhd
