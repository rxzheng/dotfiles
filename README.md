For a school computer I use macOS.

I have attached a screenshot to the setup

I do not have sudo so some of the stuff doesn't really work.

Setup details:
tmux + nvim + iTerm2 + homebrew

Packages used:
cmatrix ranger htop spt (spotify-tui) spicetify spotifyd cava

Desktop Environment:
yabai + skhd
