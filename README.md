**These are my macOS/arch dotfiles.**

Please note that this is not supposed to work automatically: create an issue if you want help setting something up.
macOS setup: yabai + skhd

Arch Linux setup: dwm/hyprland

sketchybar config from sertdfyguhi

Things that you have to do before it works:

[ ]install homebrew (you can look at my homebrewinstall repository)

[ ]install zsh-syntax highlighting package

[ ]brew install npm (for neovim)

[ ]yabai --start-service

[ ]brew services start sketchybar

[ ]brew install jq (for sketchybar)
[ ]some more stuff that i haven't thought through yet
